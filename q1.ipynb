    "**Problem Statement:**\n",
    "Implement an algorithm to evaluate q(A, B, C) :- R1(A, B), R2(B, C). Assume that each attribute has domain Z (the set of integer numbers). A common approach is to use hashing. For example, we can hash the tuples of R2 using the values in attribute B as keys and maintain a list of tuples in R2 that satisfy each key. Then, for each tuple t' in R1, we query the hashmap using Ï€_B(t') and report all tuples in R2 that can be joined with R1. We report all the resulting join tuples.\n",

    "The overall time complexity of Our solution is O(m + n), where m is the number of tuples in R1, and n is the number of tuples in R2. This is because creating the hash table takes O(n) time, and performing the join takes O(m) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correctness Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is correct because it correctly evaluates the join query q(A, B, C) :- R1(A, B), R2(B, C) by iterating over the tuples of R1 and checking if the corresponding value of attribute B exists as a key in the hash table constructed from R2. If a match is found, all tuples in R2 with that value of attribute B are joined with the current tuple from R1 to produce the resulting tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m + n), where m is the number of tuples in R1, and n is the number of tuples in R2. This is because we iterate over R1 once (O(m)) and perform constant-time lookups in the hash table for each tuple in R1 (amortized O(1) time for each lookup). The space complexity is O(n) since we store all tuples of R2 in the hash table.\n",
