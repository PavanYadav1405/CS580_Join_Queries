    "### Time Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "Our solution consists of two main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `semijoin` function:\n",
    "   - This function performs a semijoin reduction by filtering the tuples in `relation1` based on the values in `relation2`.\n",
    "   - The time complexity of this function is O(M + N), where M is the size of `relation1`, and N is the size of `relation2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `join` function:\n",
    "   - This function performs a hash-based join between two relations.\n",
    "   - The time complexity of building the hash index is O(N), where N is the size of `relation2`.\n",
    "   - The time complexity of the join operation is O(M), where M is the size of `relation1`.\n",
    "   - Therefore, the overall time complexity of the `join` function is O(M + N).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `k_line_join` function:\n",
    "   - This function performs successive joins on the list of relations.\n",
    "   - The time complexity of this function is O(N * (k - 1) + OUT), where N is the size of each relation, k is the number of relations, and OUT is the size of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The `process_and_join` function:\n",
    "   - This function performs semijoin reductions on the relations before calling `k_line_join`.\n",
    "   - The time complexity of the semijoin reductions is O(N * (k - 1)), where N is the size of each relation, and k is the number of relations.\n",
    "   - The time complexity of `k_line_join` is O(N * (k - 1) + OUT), where OUT is the size of the output.\n",
    "   - Therefore, the overall time complexity of `process_and_join` is O(N * (k - 1) + OUT).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given problem statement, the assumption is that each relation has N tuples, and the domain of each attribute is Z (the set of integer numbers). Additionally, the focus is on k-line join queries for k ≤ 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under these assumptions, the time complexity of your solution is O(N * (k - 1) + OUT), which satisfies the requirement of O(N + OUT) time complexity for k-line join queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correctness Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `semijoin` function correctly filters the tuples in `relation1` based on the values in `relation2`.\n",
    "2. The `join` function correctly performs a hash-based join between two relations, handling duplicates appropriately.\n",
    "3. The `k_line_join` function correctly performs successive joins on the list of relations, using the `join` function.\n",
    "4. The `process_and_join` function correctly performs semijoin reductions on the relations before calling `k_line_join`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution handles various test cases, including simple line join queries, queries with empty relations, queries with no matching tuples, tuples with negative values, and queries with duplicate tuples. The output matches the expected results in all these test cases."
